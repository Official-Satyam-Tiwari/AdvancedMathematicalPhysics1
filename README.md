# AdvancedMathematicalPhysics1

Scilab/Python based simulations experiments based on Mathematical Physics problems.

1. Linear algebra: Power and Inverse Power methods for finding largest and smallest Eigenvalue and eigenvectors of matrices.
2. QR Method to find Eigenvalues of a given Matrix.
3. Determination of the principal axes of moment of inertia through diagonalization (Matrix can be generated for a given distribution of discrete masses).
4. Application to solve differential equations for a bound system â€“ Eigen value problem. (PARTICLE IN 1-D BOX)
5. Application to computer graphics: Write operators for shear, strain, two dimensional rotational problems, Reflection, Translation etc. Plot old and new coordinates.
